# Harsha Microservice Udemy Practice

## Overview
This project is a .NET-based microservices practice application developed as part of a Udemy course. It demonstrates core microservices concepts, including service communication, scalability, and deployment, using modern technologies and best practices. While each service follows the Clean Architecture approach to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns, the primary focus is on the overall system architecture, emphasizing how services interact and integrate within a cohesive microservices ecosystem.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Implements loosely coupled services to demonstrate modularity and scalability.
- **Clean Architecture**: Each service adheres to Clean Architecture principles, promoting separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.
- **Service Communication**: Utilizes RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging between services.
- **API Development**: Built with ASP.NET Core Web API for robust and scalable RESTful services.
- **Containerization**: Uses Docker for containerized deployment of services.
- **Orchestration**: Leverages Kubernetes for container orchestration and management.
- **Cloud Integration**: Incorporates Azure for cloud-based deployment and services.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implements continuous integration and continuous deployment using GitHub Actions.

## Technologies Used
- **.NET Core**: Framework for building microservices and APIs.
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**: For creating RESTful services.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for asynchronous communication.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for packaging services.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for deployment and scaling.
- **Azure**: Cloud platform for hosting and managing services.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD automation.
