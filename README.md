## Overview

This repository showcases a production-ready microservices architecture built with ASP.NET Core. The primary focus is on demonstrating effective microservice communication patterns, distributed system design, and modern cloud-native practices. While each service implements Clean Architecture principles internally, the main emphasis is on the overall microservice architecture and how services interact with each other.

## Architecture Highlights

### Microservices Design

- **Independent Services**: Each microservice is self-contained with its own database, ensuring loose coupling and independent scalability
- **Service Boundaries**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined domain boundaries
- **Distributed Architecture**: Services can be deployed, scaled, and maintained independently

### Inter-Service Communication

This project implements multiple communication patterns:

- **Synchronous Communication**: RESTful HTTP APIs for real-time request-response scenarios
- **Asynchronous Communication**: RabbitMQ message broker for event-driven architecture and decoupled service interactions
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Ocelot gateway for unified entry point, routing, and cross-cutting concerns

### Key Communication Patterns

- **Request-Response**: Direct HTTP calls between services for immediate data needs
- **Event-Driven Messaging**: Publish-subscribe pattern using RabbitMQ for eventual consistency
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service location and routing
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of requests across service instances

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework

- **ASP.NET Core Web API**: Modern, cross-platform framework for building RESTful services

### Microservices Infrastructure

- **Ocelot**: API Gateway for request routing, aggregation, and cross-cutting concerns
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for asynchronous communication and event-driven architecture

### Performance & Scalability

- **Caching**: Distributed caching strategies for improved performance and reduced latency
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment and orchestration

### Cloud & Deployment

- **Azure**: Cloud platform for hosting, scaling, and managing microservices
- **Docker Containers**: Portable, lightweight environments for each service

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability

- Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand
- Horizontal scaling through container orchestration
- Caching reduces database load and improves response times

### Resilience

- Service isolation prevents cascade failures
- Asynchronous messaging provides buffering during high load
- Retry policies and circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### Maintainability

- Clean Architecture within services for organized code structure
- Clear service boundaries reduce complexity
- Independent deployment reduces risk

### Flexibility

- Technology diversity - each service can use different technologies if needed
- Easy to add new services without affecting existing ones
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous communication

## Project Structure

Each microservice follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Business entities and core logic
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and business rules
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (database, messaging, etc.)
- **API Layer**: Controllers and API endpoints

## Key Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

- Building and orchestrating multiple microservices
- Implementing various inter-service communication patterns
- Using API Gateway for centralized routing and policies
- Event-driven architecture with message brokers
- Containerization and cloud deployment strategies
- Distributed caching for performance optimization
- Managing distributed data and eventual consistency

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical implementation of microservices architecture patterns, focusing on real-world scenarios and production-ready practices. It's an excellent reference for understanding how to build, deploy, and maintain distributed systems using modern .NET technologies.
